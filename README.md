# Gallery app for the Django framework.

Work in progress

## Getting Started

So you're gonna need Django (obviously), particles-js in your STATIC_ROOT, and configure your URLS.conf file to include gallery.urls. 
Currently only works in a Django dev environment.
You may need to use Django shell to remove QuerySets and upload your own via the /admin portal :)
